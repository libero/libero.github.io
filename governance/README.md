# Governance Licence Agreement
If a new version of the Licence Agreement becomes available then the following will need to be done for the auto-generated HTML to keep it consistent with the current version

## Auto-generated HTML Styling

 - The title will need to be all in one H1 tag with no spans and line breaks
 - The other Heading tags will need to be moved up one level so H3 becomes H2, H4 become H3 etc
 - Duplicate or redundant code is removed. For example anchor links at the bottom are not duplicated.
 - Pagebreak `<div class="page-break"></div>` to be added so the pages print correctly
