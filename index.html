                  <h2>Why Libero?</h2>
                  <p>Most publishing solutions today still carry the accumulated burden of their print-era origins. Libero is something new: a publishing platform designed from the ground up to take advantage of the opportunities created by the latest web technologies.</p>

                  <p>Libero is a modern, flexible and cost-effective solution to managing, reviewing, curating, presenting, sharing and interacting with research. It’s an opportunity to reduce costs and maximise reuse with an open source solution that can be easily adapted to the needs of different content providers – whether large publishers or small, libraries or independent academics.</p>

                  <h2>Introducing Libero Publisher</h2>
                  <p>The Libero platform is launching with Libero Publisher, a post-production publishing system designed to help you deliver beautiful content to your readers, wherever they may be. Libero Publisher is available as a free self-serve solution or as a service from one of our partner service providers.</p>

                  <p><strong>Designed for humans:</strong> Libero is designed to work with you, and it can make your content look beautiful no matter how your readers reach you. Balancing elegance with accessibility, Libero’s mobile-optimised article layouts are designed for comfort but built for speed.</p>

                  <p><strong>Friendly with machines:</strong> Libero’s XML based article store makes sure your content is accessible to data mining and indexing services, and data feeds to third-party services like CrossRef and PubMed Central are built-in.</p>

                  <p><strong>Keeps you in control:</strong> Libero’s real-time publishing dashboard lets you see what’s happening, when it’s happening, letting you quickly manage your publishing queues, create issues for publication, and check that everything is working smoothly.</p>

                  <p><strong>It takes requests:</strong> Libero’s open API lets you make your content available to developers, whether it’s for a third-party service integration, content syndication, or a mobile application.</p>

                  <p><strong>And more:</strong> from Libero’s built-in Lens reader to its ElasticSearch-powered content search and recommendation engines, Libero lets you offer your readers flexible ways of finding, viewing and sharing your content.</p>

                <h2>Special interest groups</h2>
                <p>A Special Interest Group (SIG) is comprised of members from multiple organisations, with a common purpose of advancing the Libero project with respect to a specific topic. Their goal is to provide focused forums for getting work done, making topic related decisions, onboarding new contributors and advising the Project Lead or Steering Committee.</p>

                <p><strong>Technology SIG</strong> – focuses on topics related to the codebase, architecture, testing, continuous integration, deployment and related tools or services.</p>

                <p><strong>Product SIG</strong> – focuses on the product roadmap and direction of Libero in terms of a platform for the various use cases. This includes the user-experience design, user-interface design, new and existing features, prioritisation and movement of components between the different classifications.</p>

                <h2>About eLife</h2>
                <p>eLife is a non-profit organisation inspired by research funders and led by scientists. Our mission is to help scientists accelerate discovery by operating a platform for research communication that encourages and recognises the most responsible behaviours in science.</p>

                <p>eLife invests heavily in software development, new product design, collaboration and outreach so that the potential for improvements in the digital communication of new research can start to be realised. We support the development of open-source tools, with extensible capabilities, that can be used, adopted and modified by any interested party to help move towards an ecosystem that serves science and scientists as efficiently and as cost-effectively as possible.</p>

                <p>We’re pleased to offer a growing suite of tools that is open-source, with permissive licensing to enable others to adopt, use and build on the work we do.</p>

                <p>eLife also publishes work of the highest scientific standards and importance in all areas of the life and biomedical sciences. The research is selected and evaluated by working scientists and is made freely available to all readers without delay.</p>
